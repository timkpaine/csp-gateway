    # DEPRECATED auth settings
    # Historically (csp-gateway <2.5), auth was configured via these two fields
    # on Settings. In 2.5+, auth moved onto `MountAPIKeyMiddleware` as module
    # fields. Keeping these here (default-None sentinels) lets existing YAML
    # configs that set `gateway.settings.AUTHENTICATE` / `gateway.settings.API_KEY`
    # continue to validate. The `Gateway` class reads them at `start()` and
    # applies them to the middleware with a DeprecationWarning. Remove these
    # fields (and the `_apply_legacy_auth_settings()` shim in gateway.py) in a
    # future major release.
