        treats a field without a default as required, which would reject those payloads. Defaults are
        not themselves validated, so a ``None`` default coexists with constraints like ``Field(gt=0)``,
        which still apply to any value actually supplied. Use ``model_fields_set`` to tell a field the
        caller set from one that defaulted.
