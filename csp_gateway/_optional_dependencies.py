"""Which import failures mean "this extra is not installed" rather than "something is broken".

The re-export guards in `csp_gateway/__init__.py` and `csp_gateway/utils/__init__.py` have to let a
client-only install import cleanly, without also hiding genuine breakage inside modules that are
present. Telling those apart needs the import names each extra pulls in, since `pyproject.toml`
lists distributions and several of them import under a different name.
